    "# The improvements in the final results of the Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP) with 200 cities stemmed from a series of strategic adjustments. \n",
    "# By refining the genetic algorithm iteratively, parameters like population size, crossover rates, and mutation probabilities were optimized. \n",
    "# This fine-tuning enabled more efficient exploration of the solution space, resulting in the discovery of superior routes. Furthermore, \n",
    "# diverse search strategies such as roulette wheel selection and a variety of crossover and mutation techniques were instrumental in maintaining \n",
    "# diversity within the population and revealing promising solutions. The algorithm's ability to adapt to the problem's complexity, \n",
    "# combined with sufficient computational resources, also contributed significantly to the notable enhancements observed in the end results."
